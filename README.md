# üìà Real-Time Stock Monitoring and Alert System
This project focuses on developing an **AI-powered stock tracking system** that enhances trading efficiency through **real-time price monitoring, predictive analytics, and instant alert notifications**.
The system integrates:
- **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** for short-term price forecasting
- **FinBERT** for financial news sentiment analysis

Together, they provide users with **automated, data-driven insights** beyond manual tracking ‚Äî ensuring faster, smarter trading decisions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Statement
Manual stock tracking is inefficient and error-prone, often leading to delayed reactions and missed opportunities.  
Users need an intelligent, real-time system that:
- Monitors stock prices continuously
- Tracks market sentiment
- Sends **instant Buy/Sell alerts** when defined conditions are met

This ensures users can act immediately and make informed trading decisions.

## üéØ Project Objectives
| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Data Collection** | Collect real-time stock prices and financial news data via APIs. |
| **Price Prediction** | Use a **TCN model** to forecast the next stock price from historical data. |
| **Threshold Alerting** | Trigger instant **SMS alerts** through Vonage when price thresholds are met. |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Analyze daily news sentiment using **FinBERT** and summarize for users. |
| **Dashboard Visualization** | Build an interactive dashboard for live data, portfolio, and alerts. |
| **User Management** | Enable secure signup/login with **Google or phone (OTP)** authentication. |

---

## üìä Expected Outcomes
‚úÖ Automated, real-time SMS alerts for Buy/Sell decisions  
‚úÖ Interactive dashboard with live charts, performance graphs, and trade history  
‚úÖ Personalized, authenticated user access  
‚úÖ Enhanced trading responsiveness and data-backed decision making

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### üîπ Overview
The system follows an **event-driven, microservices architecture** with modular layers for frontend, backend, database, and AI models.

### üîπ Workflow
#### Step 1: User Authentication
- Secure login via **Google OAuth** or **Phone OTP**
- User profiles stored in **MongoDB**

#### Step 2: Data Ingestion
- **Price Data:** Collected from stock APIs
- **News Data:** Processed through **FinBERT** for sentiment scoring
- **Historical Data:** Stored in **TimescaleDB** for time-series optimization

#### Step 3: Price Prediction
- **PyTorch TCN** model predicts the next stock price using the last 30 data points

#### Step 4: Alert & Notification
- **Celery + Redis** scheduler continuously checks for threshold breaches
- On trigger, sends **Buy/Sell alerts** to users via **Vonage SMS API**

#### Step 5: Dashboard Visualization
- Built with **React.js** and **Chart.js / Recharts**
- Displays live prices, sentiment scores, trade history, and performance analytics
